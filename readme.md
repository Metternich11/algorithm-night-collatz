# The Collatz Sequence
## Instructions
Create a function which computes the Collatz Conjecture sequence for a positive integer n.
The sequence is calculated as follows:
- If n is even, the next number in the sequence is n / 2
- If n is odd, the next number in the sequence is 3 * n + 1
- If n is 1, we have reached the end of the sequence (notice that once we reach 1, the sequence will end up in a loop of 1 => 4 => 2 => 1)

Now, create a second function which finds the number n with the longest Collatz sequence between 1 and positive integer i. If two numbers have the same sequence length, return the smaller of the two numbers.
